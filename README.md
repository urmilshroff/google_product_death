# Google Product Death Countdown

If you hate the fact that Google is killing off half of the products that you use and love because "not many people use them", you've come to the right place.

## Products on death row:

- Hangouts (some time in this or the next decade, we all know it's happening)

## Products that have already been killed:

- Allo (May 2016-March 2019)
- Inbox by Gmail (October 2014-April 2019)
- Google+ (2011-April 2019)
