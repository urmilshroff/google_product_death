# Google Product Death Countdown

If you hate the fact that Google is killing off half of the products that you use and love because "not many people use them", you've come to the right place.

## Products/services on death row:
- Inbox by Gmail (March 2019)
- Allo (March 2019)
- Google+ (2nd April 2019)
- Hangouts (some time in this or the next decade, we all know it's happening)
